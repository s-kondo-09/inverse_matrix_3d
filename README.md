This program calculates the inverse of a 3Ã—3 matrix. The program first takes nine input values from the user, which correspond to the elements of the matrix, denoted as $`a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_9`$. These values are entered by the user in the following format:
```math
\begin{pmatrix}
a_1 & a_2 & a_3\\
a_4 & a_5 & a_6\\
a_7 & a_8 & a_9
\end{pmatrix}
```
After calculating the inverse of the matrix, the program saves both the original matrix and its inverse to a file called `info.dat`. This project was created as part of a university assignment in 2020.
