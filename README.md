This program calculate inverse of a 3Ã—3 matrix after taking input values between a(1) and a(9) from the user, where a(i) is defined as 

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
a(1) & a(2) & a(3)\\
a(4) & a(5) & a(6)\\
a(7) & a(8) & a(9)
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Then, the data are saved into a file called info.dat. It was created for a university assignment in 2020.
